		<h3><a href="#">NXT Tour Golf Ball</a></h3> 
		</hgroup> 
		<p>You are driven to be the best player you can be.</em> Engineered for high
		performance, the new NXT Tour and NXT Tour S golf balls will help you 
		reach your potential. <span>Both NXT and NXT Tour S deliver low driver and
		long iron spin for <strong>outstanding distance</strong> and also offer excellent short game
		scoring performance and soft feel.</span> Golfers can find an NXT Tour that meets
		their personal preferences as NXT Tour S provides a softer compression
		feel and is available in white and optic yellow. PGA 
			Professionals strive for this kind of deep and meaningful connection 
			with their members and students every day. Tim Fleming, PGA head 
			Professional at Oklahoma City Golf & Country Club, is well-known for 
			his accomplishments on the course. He was a first-team All-American 
			and part of a national Championship team at Oklahoma state, and 
			competed in numerous major championships. And Tim has the same focus 
			and desire to succeed in his many other roles as a PGA Professional. 
			he’s relentless when it comes to finding ways to explain a teaching 
			technique so it clicks with the player, or working to enhance the 
			experience at the club to encourage more play from the membership. 
			At titleist, we celebrate the thousands of PGA Professionals like Tim, 
			who are constantly improving themselves and searching for new ways to 
			make a meaningful impact on their students, members and the game overall. 
			Visit titleist.com/bestpractices to learn more about Tim and how he leads 
			by example.</p>
